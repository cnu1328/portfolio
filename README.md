# Clone And Use 📋

- The website is completely built on `react-js` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed.
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page.
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  - ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cnu1328/portfolio.git
    ```
  - This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  - ```node
    npm install
    ```
- Now, the project is ready to use.
- You can check it using `npm start`, it will open the website locally on your browser.

# Customize it to make your own portfolio ✏️

In this project, there are basically 4 things that you need to change to customize this to anyone else's portfolio: **package.json**, **Personal Information**, **Github Information** and **Splash Logo**.

### package.json

Open this file, which is in the main cloned directory, choose any "name" and change "homepage " to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. Do not forget the `https://`, otherwise fonts will not load.

### Personal Information

You will find `src/portfolio.js` file which contains the complete information about the user. The file looks something like below:

```javascript
// Home Page
const greeting = {
    ...
}

// Social Media
const socialMediaLinks = {
    ...
}

...
```

You can change the personal information, experience, education, social media, certifications, blog information, contact information etc. in `src/portfolio.js` to directly reflect them in portfolio website.
